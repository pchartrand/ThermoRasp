# ThermoRasp
Thermostat made with a ADS1015 12 bits ADC on a raspberrypi 2.

## Requirements:

An [ADS1015](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1083) board.

A 310 NTC thermistor and a 5k6 resistor for temperature measurement.

A SSRNC-430B solid-state relay with a 68 Î© series resistor for heater control. 

## Principle of operation:

The flask application integrates the different components 
(adc, temperature calculation, relay control, thermostat logic).

It makes system status and control possible thru a REST API.

Temperature control is done via a periodic temperature check REST call to the flask app.

Target temperature setting is done via another REST call.

## Dependencies

`sudo pip install flask`

`sudo pip install gpiozero`

## Integration testing:

To make sure the system components work properly, use the following python script :

`./test.py`

## Setup:

Start flask server

`./startup.sh`

Start polling process (checks temperature once a minute).

`nohup poll.sh &`

## Usage:

To check current status (temperature, target, heating):

`./status.sh`

To change control mode to manual:

`./manual.sh`

To set thermostat to another target temperature, say 21.5:

`./set.sh 21.5`

To force evaluation of current temperature:

`./check.sh`

To change control mode to automatic:

`./automatic.sh`

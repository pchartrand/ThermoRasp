def convert_to_temperature(value):
    '''
    :value is an integer between 0 and 1023.

    Assuming a third degree polynomial relationship between voltage
    and temperature with a voltage divider made of an NTC 310
    thermistor (pullup) and a 5k6 resistor (to ground).
    Voltage is measured across the 5k6 resistor.

    This is more empirical than the Steinhartâ€“Hart coefficients approach,
    but yields good results in normal temperature ranges.
